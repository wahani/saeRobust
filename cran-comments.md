-   I have resolved the one note on
    https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_saeRobust.html
-   There seems to be a problem running the tests when using ATLAS, see
    https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/Rblas/ATLAS/saeRobust.out I do not have a way to reproduce
    this specific environment and now skip the execution of the tests.
